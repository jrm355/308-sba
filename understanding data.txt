{learner submissions [0,1, 2] , 

---Mention [2] doesn't have a grade, consider using a break, need to loop through/ due date in more than 1000 years from now

learnerSubmissions.score [0] + learnerSubmissions.score[1] / Assignmentinfo.points_possible [0] + assignnetinfo.points_possible [1],

Asignmentinfo.id[0] learnerSubmissions [0] / assignment info [0]
